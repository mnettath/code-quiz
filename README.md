## Description

I created this coding quiz in order to better understand how to use JavaScript to solve a task. I also became more familiar with using DOM traversal and local storage. While building this quiz was a complex task, it helped me better understand the importance of breaking down a task into smaller parts.

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- What was your motivation?
- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")
- What problem does it solve?
- What did you learn?

## Usage

This quiz is multiple choice and has 5 questions total. To begin the quiz, click "Start Quiz!". The first question will be displayed and the timer will start its countdown from 100. Users can use their mouse to click on the answer they think is correct. If the user answers the question incorrectly, 15 seconds will be taken away from the countdown. If the user answers the question correctly, no time will be taken from the countdown. Once all 5 questions are answered, or if the timer runs out, the user will be able to view their final score and can enter their initials. Once they hit submit, they will be taken to the high scores page. Here, they can see their score along with the scores of other users.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative file path, add it to your README using the following syntax:
