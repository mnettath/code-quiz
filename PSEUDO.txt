Mod 4 Game plan:

HTML
- link to our high scores page: rendering the high scores stored in localStorage, use anchor tag

- create 3 sections in your index.html file - DONE

1: start section
- start button: attach event listener
    timer starts (low priority)
    hide start section
    show quiz section 
    display a question 
    
2: quiz section (objects with arrays in them)
    recommended data structure: 
    var questions = 
    [
        {
            title: first question, 
            choices: ['red', 'green', 'blue', 'yellow']
            answer: [0] or 'red'
        }
    ]
build a displayQuestion function (purpose: renders the question)
attaching click events to each option in html 
when clicked check is answer is correct or incorrect 
if correct, display next question
if wrong, timer/score decrements by 10 seconds 
timer/score <= 0 
    if 0, game ends, if < 0 
if last question
    display results
    else next question 
3: results 
    form OR an input with a button 
        when button is clicked 
            grab score and itials and store them in local storage 
            recommended data structure: 
                array of objects 
                [
                    {
                        initials: jmm,
                        score: 50
                    },
                ]
            append to local storage, do not want to override
- show start section and hide other 2 sections 

highscores.html 
    display all scores in desc order from local storage 
    highscore.js (optional)
